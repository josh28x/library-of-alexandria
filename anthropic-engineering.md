building a multi-agent research system


A multi-agent system consists of multiple agents (LLMs autonomously using tools in a loop) working together.

This involves an agent that 
- plans a research process based on user queries, and then
- uses tools to create parallel agents that search for information simultaneously.


 Systems with multiple agents introduce new challenges in
 - agent coordination,
 -  evaluation, and
 -  reliability.
